# *Tax Rebates and Incentives*

Information on available tax rebates and incentives for adopting green technologies.

There are several different tax incentives for adopting green technologies. Some of these incentives include:

## *Clean Vehicle Tax Credits*

Buyers of clean vehicles may be eligible for one of three credits:

- **Up to $4,000** for buyers of qualified, previously owned clean vehicles. [List of qualified vehicles.](link)
- **Up to $7,500** for buyers of qualified, new clean vehicles. [List of qualified vehicles (2023 and later)](link) [List of qualified vehicles (2022 and earlier)](link)
- **Up to $1,000** toward the cost of a home EV charger. [Check eligibility.](link)

However, there are income restrictions in place regarding tax credits for clean vehicles:

- For new clean vehicle purchases in 2023 and beyond, your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI, [details here](link)) for either the current year or prior year must be:
  - $300,000 or less, if you file taxes jointly with your spouse or are a surviving spouse
  - $225,000 or less, if you file taxes as the head of a household
  - $150,000 or less, for other filers
- For used clean vehicle purchases, your modified adjusted gross income for either the current year or prior year must be:
  - $150,000 or less, if you file taxes jointly with your spouse or are a surviving spouse
  - $112,500 or less, if you file taxes as the head of a household
  - $75,000 or less, for other filers

Visit the [FuelEconomy.gov Tax Center](link) to determine whether a vehicle qualifies for a tax credit, navigate eligibility requirements, and read frequently asked questions regarding tax credits for clean vehicles.

Starting on Jan. 1, 2024, eligible consumers will have the option to transfer the value of the tax credit to dealers that meet certain requirements in exchange for an equivalent reduction in the vehicleâ€™s purchase price. That would mean an immediate reduction of the price of the vehicle at the point of sale rather than waiting for a tax credit after filing taxes.

## *Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit*

If you make qualified energy-efficient improvements to your home after Jan. 1, 2023, you may qualify for a tax credit of up to $3,200. You can claim the credit for improvements made through 2032.

For improvements installed in 2022 or earlier: Use previous versions of [Form 5695](link).

Beginning Jan. 1, 2023, the credit equals 30% of certain qualified expenses, including:

- Qualified energy efficiency improvements installed during the year
- Residential energy property expenses
- Home energy audits

There are limits on the allowable annual credit and on the amount of credit for certain types of qualified expenses. The credit is allowed for qualifying property placed in service on or after Jan. 1, 2023, and before Jan. 1, 2033.

The maximum credit you can claim each year is:

- $1,200 for energy property costs and certain energy-efficient home improvements, with limits on doors ($250 per door and $500 total), windows ($600), and home energy audits ($150)
- $2,000 per year for qualified heat pumps, biomass stoves, or biomass boilers

The credit has no lifetime dollar limit. You can claim the maximum annual credit every year that you make eligible improvements until 2033.

The credit is nonrefundable, so you can't get back more on the credit than you owe in taxes. You can't apply any excess credit to future tax years.

**Who qualifies:**
You may claim the energy-efficient home improvement credit for improvements to your main home. Your main home is generally where you live most of the time.

For the energy efficiency home improvement credit, the home must be:

- Located in the United States
- An existing home that you improve or add onto, not a new home
- In most cases, the home must be your primary residence (where you live the majority of the year). You can't claim the credit if you're a landlord or other property owner who doesn't live in the home.

**Business use of home:**
If you use a property solely for business purposes, you can't claim the credit.

If you use your home partly for business, the credit for eligible clean energy expenses is as follows:

- Business use up to 20%: full credit
- Business use more than 20%: credit based on share of expenses allocable to nonbusiness use

- Be conducted and prepared by a home energy auditor

Starting in 2024, the following additional requirements must be met:

- The inspection must be conducted by a qualified home energy auditor, defined as an individual who is certified by one of the qualified certification Programs listed on the [Department of Energy certification programs](link) for the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (Section 25C) at the time of the audit, or under the supervision of a qualified home energy auditor;
